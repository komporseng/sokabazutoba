These are the most googled celebrities of the year.</p><p>Research from Hollywood news site <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CelebTattler</a> analyzed data points from Google search trends in 2022, tracking over 150 notable celebrities — and eventually crowning “Aquaman” star Amber Heard as No. 1.</p><p>Presumably due to<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> her high profile court battle with her ex</a>, the 36-year-old actress topped the list as the most searched A-lister of 2022, with an average of 5.6 million searches every month in the US. Of course, the ex in question, Johnny Depp, trailed closely behind in second place, earning 5.5 million searches per month.</p><p>The pair <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">consumed pop culture</a> as their bombshell defamation trial raged on for a good chunk of the year,<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> which culminated </a>in June with Depp being awarded $15 million from his ex, and Heard reaping $2 million in her countersuit.</p><p>Between<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> entry wristband frenzies</a>,<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> viral TikToks</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">romance rumors</a>, it’s no wonder why the ex-flames topped the charts, as even in internet research results the two still go head-to-head. While Heard was the most googled in sheer volume of searches, 34 out of 50 states searched for the “Pirates of the Caribbean” actor more than any other A-lister.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Heard was the top-searched A-lister this year following her bombshell defamation trial with her ex. <span class=credit>POOL/AFP via Getty Images</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Depp trailed his ex-flame as a close second. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>“This year has certainly not been lacking when it comes to celebrity news stories, whether it be Elon Musk taking over Twitter or the ‘Don’t Worry Darling’ behind the scenes drama,” a spokesperson from CelebTattler told The Post in a statement.</p><p>The tumultuous ex-spouses were followed by Kim Kardashian, Elon Musk, Tom Brady, Pete Davidson and even the late Queen Elizabeth II, who received third place.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Britain’s longest reigning monarch</a> passed in September at 96 years of age after seven decades on the throne — and it earned her 4.3 million Google searches per month for the year.</p><p>Football star Tom Brady was the most googled A-list athlete in 2022, and the fourth most searched celebrity. Perhaps due to his<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> unexpected divorce </a>from his supermodel ex-wife Gisele Bündchen or his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">on-again off-again relationship</a> with the NFL, Brady’s search total rang in at 4.06 million per month.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The queen graced the list in third place, trailing behind the other two celebrities. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Brady was the most searched athlete of the year. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>Speaking of tumultuous couples, Kim Kardashian and her<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> ex-beau Pete Davidson</a> placed fifth and sixth respectively. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">As the pair’s unlikely romance grew steamier</a> following the reality TV star’s stint on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Saturday Night Live</a> last fall, the couple became pop culture icons — as if Kim K wasn’t already.</p><p>The SKIMS and SKNN founder, who sparked debate after donning an original <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Marilyn Monroe</a> dress at the Met Gala, was googled 3.4 million times per month in 2022. Davidson, on the other hand, amassed a monthly average of 3.2 million, and might rake in even more clicks before the end of the year as he garners attention over his<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> new flame supermodel Emily Ratajkowski</a>.</p><p>This year, the two become <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the focal points of digs from Ye</a>, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West and ex-husband of Kardashian.
