While there were hints that this might happen throughout season 2, it has now been confirmed and we are incredibly excited about it!</p><p>While the plot of season 3&nbsp;has already been announced to the public, details about where the writers will take the show are still under wraps.&nbsp;All we know so far is that it will focus on the 2011 comic book issue named ‘Flashpoint’ (more details on that <a href=#>here</a>). West’s introduction as Kid Flash could be directly linked to this storyline, as there is an opening for a new Speedster, with Barry Allen no longer being The Flash. Just last week it was also announced that Tom Felton will feature throughout the season as Julian Dorn and now, a first look at Wally West in his Kid Flash costume has been released to the public eye.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/first-look-at-kid-flashs-costume-01.jpg alt="First Look At Kid Flash's Costume! 1" width=450 height=669 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>We are very happy with this design. While the designers have made a few changes to the original comic book costume, as always they have stayed through to the character and we can’t wait to see what Lonsdale can do in this attire!&nbsp;Season 3 premiers on The CW on October 4th.</p><p>What do you think of Kid Flash’s costume?
