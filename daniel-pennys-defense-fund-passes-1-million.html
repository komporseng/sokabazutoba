But he didn’t go in there trying to hurt anyone. He was trying to help.”</p><p>Penny’s attorney Thomas Kenniff said he is “confident” that his client “will be absolved of any wrongdoing.”</p><p>Penny “is no stranger to adversity,” Kenniff told The Post. “He enlisted into the Marine Corps out of high school. While many of his peers opted for comforts of college life, Daniel swore an oath to defend his country.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Penny placed Jordan Neely in a fatal chokehold on May 1.</figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Penny joined the Marines after high school. <span class=credit>@givesendgo.com/daniel_penny</span></figure><p>“He is prepared to face this case with that same resolve, and humbled to know he is not walking that path alone.”</p><p>Fund proceeds that “exceed those necessary to cover Mr. Penny’s legal defense” will be given to a New York City mental health program, his attorneys wrote on the crowdfunding platform.</p><p>In a shocking video, Penny wrapped his arms around the neck of the homeless Neely with the help of other commuters.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Penny was arraigned on manslaughter charges on Friday. <span class=credit>Paul Martinka</span></figure><p>According to <a href=#>witness accounts, Neely was acting erratically</a> and was threatening other passengers before Penny stepped in.</p><p>Neely had a <a href=#>long history of mental illness</a> and had several prior arrests.</p><p>The city medical examiner ruled Neely’s death a homicide, noting he died due to “compression of neck (chokehold).”</p><p>GiveSendGo,&nbsp;which&nbsp;bills itself as “The #1 Free Christian Fundraising Site,” was founded in 2014 as an alternative to GoFundMe –&nbsp;the crowdfunding behemoth that has been criticized for&nbsp;removing&nbsp;campaigns that&nbsp;go against progressive orthodoxy.</p><p>“GiveSendGo does not support right-wing causes over left-wing causes,”&nbsp;Wells said Friday, but “allows campaigns, that are legal endeavors, from all sides of the political/ideological divide.”</p><p>Last year, the website opened its platform to Jose Alba,&nbsp;the Manhattan&nbsp;bodega&nbsp;worker who was charged by Bragg’s office for stabbing an attacker, after <a href=#>GoFundMe deleted Alba’s defense fund</a> from its website.</p><p>In 2020, a GiveSendGo fund-raiser&nbsp;collected more than $520,000&nbsp;to defray legal fees for Kyle Rittenhouse, who was acquitted of all charges in shootings that killed two rioters and injured a third in Kenosha, Wisconsin.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j25mamtfma6vtcSlZKmdnqPGtHnDnp2epqOaeqfBzZ1kqZmjqLK0eZBmpKKknJ68r3s%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogS - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
