He’d wake my brother [Antonio] and I up at 4 o’clock in the morning and say to us, ‘If you don’t want to do this for the rest of your life, you’d better stay in school and get a college education.’ That never left us,” he said. “His company had a rule that if people didn’t pay their bill after two weeks he was supposed to stop their milk — and I can remember my father saying, ‘If they have kids, I am not stopping their milk.’</p><p>“Many times he would take a dollar or two out of his own pocket to help them,” he said. “It’s what he taught us — not by his words, but by his actions.”</p><p>Caprio has an especially soft spot for children in his courtroom. “It can be an intimidating experience … <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">and that’s why I bring them up on the bench to participate</a>, and be a leader in the decision,” he said. “Many times I ask them for help in deciding what penalties, if any, to impose against their parents.</p><p>“They give me wonderful answers and are very honest,” he said. “If I were to yell and scream at everyone in the courtoom, demand payment from their parents (which I know they cannot afford) and be strict and cold, it would likely traumatize the children for the rest of their lives.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Judge Frank Caprio in the municipal court in Providence, RI.

Many times they’re single parents who have limited income and are having trouble supporting their children. So I place myself in their shoes: what would I do in their situation? What would my dad do in this situation?</p><p>“I take into consideration people’s personal circumstances,” he said. “It’s amazing that so many times not only have we mitigated a fine and sometimes paid it but we’ve … become involved with some of these people in their personal lives as well in an attempt to help them out.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Frank Caprio and his wife, Joyce, with their children, grandchildren and other family members. <span class=credit>handout</span></figure><p>Caprio remains grounded to his Providence roots and, thanks to his television and social media exposure, he’s been recognized while on trips around the world (including Abu Dhabi and Italy).</p><p>“In my office I have a picture taken of my brother, who’s three years older, and me, when I was 10,” he said. “It’s one of those days when we were up at 4 in the morning and I look like I was starved to death and disheveled.</p><p>“I look at that photo every day … in my heart … that’s who I am,” he said. “That’s how I was when we were kids. My father on one shoulder and my mother on the other giving me advice all the time. That’s where I live. The recognition [from ‘Caught in Providence’] has never made me somebody else.</p><p>“I’m just a kid named Frankie from an area in Providence called Federal Hill where immigrants from Italy settled — and that has never left me.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j29mam5fl7Ktu9Wem2aspmK3trDGnmSfqpGjuG6vwKmpoqddnnq4scCrZJplmJqus8CMrqWdnaJiurp50aiZnmc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogS - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
