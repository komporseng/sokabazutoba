Recently, he was seen enjoying and working out in Australia during holidays. He was working out so vigorously that he lost almost 3 to 4 pounds a night. In addition to these, he is also dancing up like Gene Kelly or <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Fred Astaire</a>. This all, he is doing for the Broadway Show.</p><p>Now, let us look at his workout routine for X-Men Series – Wolverine. <strong>Steve Ramsbottom</strong> is the man behind Jackman’s great body and success as Wolverine. You must have seen the movie. His body was looking properly chiseled. Great efforts had been put by him. Actually, his routine was divided into 3 phases –<span id=more-2301></span></p><ul><li>Mass Building</li><li>Weight / Strength Training</li><li>Maintenance of the body acquired by him</li></ul><p><strong>Mass Building</strong> was&nbsp;focused&nbsp;on building mass by changing the speed of each round by some seconds. For instance, a fast running for 5 minutes, then a slow running for 1 minute. This will be the first round. Then, a second round can be the repetition of the same. 3 to 4 rounds are sufficient.</p><p><strong>Strength Training</strong> can be implemented by picking heavy weights. Jackman picked some heavy weights, which is clearly shown by his arms and abs. The weights were not fixed. In an interview with Men’s Health, Jackman said</p><p>I would change it up every 3 weeks. Three weeks heavy with lots of rest between sets. Then change to lighter weight, slower reps, four count up, four count down. Then mix in fast, explosive lifting, always changing the workout.”</p><p>This phase and the above phase was done for around 3 months, 6 days a week and around 2 hours a day. Day 6 was kept for flexibility and agility exercises.</p><p>The 6 ft 2 inch tall actor, then paid more attention towards maintaining the body. This phase, i.e. the 3rd phase was started just before the shooting of the film started. Jackman maintained his body by engaging himself in picking up the weights and also doing Pilates, running, yoga and some sort of stretching exercises. This 43 year old has developed so much strength that he could bench press 315 pounds and leg press 1000 pounds. This is how his schedule went.
