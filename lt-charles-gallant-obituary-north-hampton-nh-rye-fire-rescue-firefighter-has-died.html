Charles Gallant Obituary, Death – </strong>It is with profound sorrow that we learn of the passing of Lt. Charles Gallant, a dedicated member of Rye Fire Rescue with a commendable 20-year tenure. Lt. Gallant, who devoted his career to serving the New Hampshire Seacoast community, passed away at home on December 15, 2023, following an overtime shift. His commitment to helping others extended beyond emergency response, as evidenced by his volunteer work with the Rye Toy Bank, MDA, and his role as the Local 4411 Union President.</p><p>Lt. Gallant’s contributions to the community were marked by selflessness and bravery. In 2014, he was honored with the Paul W. Sypek Medal of Valor for displaying conspicuous bravery at extreme risk of life during the rescue of a fellow firefighter at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard.</p><p>The loss of Lt. Charles Gallant is deeply felt by his family, friends, and colleagues, and our hearts go out to them during this challenging time. His exceptional service, sacrifice, and the positive impact he made on the lives of others will be remembered and cherished. Details regarding memorial services and tributes will be shared in the coming days. For media inquiries, please contact Rye Fire Chief Mark Cotreau. If there are specific details or aspects you would like to discuss further or expand upon, please let me know.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwuNNmmqGZoqGytHnGmqOlmZ6perCuyK2smqqpYruwvtOhZKGZnaXBsLqMp59mqqmaeqe10Z5kq52jmMKmecWiqZ6emZy1tbHRZp%2Baq12Ztqawjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogS - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
