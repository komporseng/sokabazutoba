He worked on his upcoming songs in 2018 and 2019, acquired a contract with Atlantic Records and Dj Drama, and dropped his significant first mixtape, “Loose.” Following the release of many singles, Harlow issued “Confetti,” a 12-track mixtape featuring Bryson Tiller, 2forwOyNE, and EST Gee.

When the two of them were spotted together at the BET Awards in June 2021, rumors began circulating.

When they were observed at a boxing fight in Atlanta the same month, the myth got its start. Addison liked many of Harlow’s posts on social media and followed her for a time.
