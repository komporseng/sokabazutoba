While most of the story is based on his experiences in real life, he’s received a lot of criticisms and questions about his authenticity. Despite this, Walter has made a significant amount of wealth in the business world which is the reason for his high net worth.</p><p>How rich is Walter O’Brien? Sources inform us that his net worth is at $10 million as of early 2016, mostly earned through the success of his company Scorpion Computer Services. Detailed information about the company though is shrouded in mystery, and has been identified by several sources with various classifications – it has been called a security and risk management company, and an artificial intelligence company. He’s also worked on other projects outside of the company, which have helped raise his wealth.</p><h3>Walter O’Brien Net Worth $10 Million</h3><p>Walter became interest in computers at a very young age. At St. Patrick’s National School in Clonroche, he was given an IQ test by one of his teachers and was said to have scored 197. While documentation about this no longer exists, if it was the truth, Walter could have the fourth highest IQ ever recorded. Many, however, question why he does not take the Mensa test to officially publish his scores. Walter O’Brien attended St. Mary’s Christian Brothers School (CBS), and this was when his interest computers began. According to him, Walter managed to hack NASA at the age of 12 under the pseudonym “Scorpion”, which then prompted the NSA and Interpol to find him. He eventually made a deal with the agency to provide information about the system’s vulnerability in exchange for his safety. According to O’Brien most of the details about this ordeal are surrounded in non-disclosure agreements, which is why he can’t state any detailed information. Based on the research of technological news companies, there seems to be no indication that NASA was hacked or that Interpol was mobilized around the time of his supposed actions. O’Brien eventually completed his Leaving Certificate at St. Kieran’s College and graduated with a degree in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence from the University of Sussex.</p><p>He is said to have established Scorpion Computer Services from the age of thirteen and then brought the company stateside when he moved to Los Angeles in 2001. Around this time his net worth was starting to get established. Walter was issued with an E11 visa, which is reserved for people classified as national assets, or those having extraordinary abilities. He is the CEO of Scorpion Computer Services and the company is said to be run with independent contractors. Aside from Scorpion, O’Brien is the Chief Scientist of Langford & Carmichael, and also founded ConciergeUp.com.</p><p>Eventually the network CBS approached Walter to discuss the series “Scorpion”, based on his life experiences. He became the executive producer of the show and regularly contributes to the show’s story development and technical aspects. He also consults with <a href=#>Elyes Gabel</a>, the actor who portrays the fictional O’Brien character.</p><p>Aside from the information regarding his migration to the United States, not much is known about Walter’s personal life. It is shrouded in mystery much like many of the claims he’s made about his life. People speculate on whether or not the information he gives is true, or maybe the numerous non-disclosure agreements through his life have kept the truth from being disclosed. Of course, this mystery is all part of the attraction of this unusual man.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=7.1840101522843><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Walter O'Brien</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$10 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>24 February 1975</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Clonroche, County Wexford Ireland</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Profession</td><td>Businessman, information technologist, executive producer, media personality,</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Education</td><td>St. Mary’s Christian Brothers School (CBS), St. Kieran’s College, University of Sussex</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>Irish</td></tr><tr readability=0.38095238095238><td>LinkedIn</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://se.linkedin.com/in/waltero</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.25806451612903><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.imdb.com/name/nm6270388</a></td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=12><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=4><td>1</td><td>Walter O'Brien provided the initial funding for Taxi Watch Kilkenny, a suicide prevention program that saved over 50 lives in 2015.</td></tr><tr readability=13><td>2</td><td>Walter O'Brien was among the decision makers at the 2015 XPRIZE Visioneering workshop.
