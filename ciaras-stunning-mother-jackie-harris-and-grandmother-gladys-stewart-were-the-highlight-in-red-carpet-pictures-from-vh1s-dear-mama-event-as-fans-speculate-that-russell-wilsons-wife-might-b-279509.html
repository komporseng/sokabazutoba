That’s pretty sweet. She was in shock. And it’s beautiful, and now I have two babies, and the shock never gets old for my mom. It’s a sweet thing to be able to share with your mother, and my mom was really proud and excited that she [was] going to be a grandma for the first and second time!”</p><p>Russell Wilson’s wife also shared the best advice her mother gave her: “The best piece of advice was [about] motherhood. When I was going to enter mommyhood, she was like, ‘Don’t worry. Everything will fall in place.’ That was really comforting to know because you’re so curious about this thing that you’ve never experienced before. It’s very foreign to your mind and your body, and with motherhood that is true, it just falls into place. You don’t need to worry about the process.”</p><p>Fans loved the three ladies, and they also believe that Ciara might be pregnant with baby number 3 because of the ruffles hiding her belly.</p><p>One person said: “Sis pregnant 😍Looking gorgeous pretty mum 😍😍💕💕Honestly that is three generations of Gorgeousness. You look terrific💜💜💜Can we shout out to the stylist 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽…. somebody, grab a fan this train is Flawless!!! ❤️”</p><p>Another commenter stated: “Ciara this is just beautiful ❤️three generations of beauty and class bless each of you always.”</p><p>This supporter claimed to have seen a baby bump and added: “Is that a baby bump? How beautiful three generations of ultimate Beauty glowing and it’s showing your beautiful daughter Sienna has a beautiful surrounding of strong Beautiful women to look up to learn and grow from and with all that unconditional love, Self-esteem, Knowledge is not only priceless, but it teaches and shows true Beauty comes from the inside to the outside and that’s what this picture radiates to me. #GirlPower💪, stay blessed in all your endeavors and your beautiful family unit.
