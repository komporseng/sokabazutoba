The youngster’s mother, Alexis Adams, is gearing up for a lawsuit for negligence.<br>According to <a href=# rel=noopener>TMZ</a>,</p><p>“The 6-year-old’s mom Alexis Adams filed <a href=# rel=noopener>a lawsuit</a> Monday against various entities she claims are responsible for her son’s fall from the Jersey City, NJ building. The defendants include a construction company and a window installation company.”</p><p>Alexis alleges negligence on the part of the construction company and window installation company for “incorrect-sized guards.” Zohar suffered a lacerated liver, collapsed lungs, fractures to his feet and pelvis, and internal bleeding as a result of the fall.</p><p>“As a single mom to a special needs child, this feels like a nightmare,” Adams told <a href=# rel=noopener>the press</a> in <a href=# rel=noopener>a statement</a>. “My heart is broken into a million pieces,” she added. “I am devastated, angry, and struggling to come to terms with the fact that my only child has suffered severe injuries due to willful negligence of our landlord and others involved In failing to take necessary safety measures.”</p><p>Flo Rida has not released a statement regarding the incident. Some news outlets allege the recording artist has never met his son with Alexis Adams.</p><p>It is not uncommon for Flo Rida to be silent about his personal affairs. The ‘Low’ rapper has, after all, shown himself to be all about the music. It was during a 2018 interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>Billboard</a> that the recording artist shared the secret to his success in the industry.</p><p>“My drive. I live music. I am music,” Flo Rida shared. “Throughout my day, I’m always thinking of different melodies, always listening to different genres of music, and I love it,” <a href=# rel=noopener>the rapper</a> revealed. “I wouldn’t call it work — when you love something, it shows, and I think that’s why I’m so successful because I really love it.”</p><p>Zohar is still in a full-body cast and will reportedly have to learn to walk again after the injuries he sustained from falling from his apartment’s window. The lawsuit Alexis filed against the construction and window companies is ongoing.</p><p>Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiak6C8r7jIp5xnm5%2BifHN8kWxmaWtfaH1wssuoZKuhlJZ6d3nYnpirZZ%2BhsW6%2FzqdkoqZdnrC2ecCfq56qXWp6tMDOq7BmnpGhuW6y0aikZpmglr%2B1ucSnq2avmaOxsMOO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogS - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
