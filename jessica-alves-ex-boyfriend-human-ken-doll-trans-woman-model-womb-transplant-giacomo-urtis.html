"I would love a baby that has my own genes and blood, and I have my frozen sperm so I could use that for IVF."</p><p>"All I wanted was to be a woman and having gender reassignment surgery was the happiest day of my life. But having a womb would be even better — I would feel complete if I could give birth," she explained, adding, "I would love to have a brood of children. It would make me so happy to be called 'mummy'." Alves said she is currently speaking to doctors about the womb transplant and hopes to become the first trans woman to have the procedure.</p><h2 class=split>Who is Jessica Alves' ex-boyfriend Giacomo Urtis?</h2><p>Alves was previously dating celebrity plastic surgeon Giacomo Urtis, who embarked on a medical career at a very young age to become a "VIP surgeon". Urtis was born in 1977 in Caracas to parents of Italian origins. His family returned to Sardinia in the first years of his life, and it was where he grew up and started his studies. Urtis graduated from the University of Sassari with a degree in medicine and surgery specializing in dermatology and venereology. He later got a master's degree in aesthetic surgery and opened his first studio, exclusively for VIP patients.</p><p>Urtis has been rather transparent about undergoing numerous aesthetic touch-ups himself, offering to personally try the treatments that would be offered in his beauty clinics. Over the years, he became a much-loved television personality in his capacity as a celebrity surgeon. Additionally, he has acted in the web series 'The Lady', by Lory Del Santo, and even released some musical singles that found success online. In 2017, Urtis was one of the contenders of the Isola Dei Famosi, and in 2020, he grabbed headlines as he joined the cast of 'Big Brother VIP'.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/e0f09da0-467e-4a1d-8a5a-e59143ede58b.162453084><p><a href=# rel>MEAWW</a> previously reported how Urtis was spotted planting a kiss on Alves’s enhanced breasts outside a restaurant in Milan, Italy, last October.</p><p>At the time, Jessica told the Daily Mail that they were just good friends and not dating anymore. "We are great close friends. Three years ago we had a relationship that led to a strong friendship and last year we recorded a song together, Plastic World, that became a hit in Italy and Spain and we are always supporting each other. It has been one year now that I started my transition and Giacomo has always been very supportive,” she said, adding: “We tried a relationship before and it didn’t work now we are just close friends.”</p><p>Earlier in the same month, the two were seen locking lips while walking around in Milan.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/4d7a9f9f-59f0-4e09-83b9-62eda8206d77.162648729><p>Alves has previously told Daily Mail how she was "desperate" to lose her virginity following her sex-change procedure. "I am desperate to lose my virginity after my sex-change surgery and I have been on the hunt for the right guy, but no luck," she told the newspaper. "I've been using Tinder in order to chat to those who are supposed to be a match but I haven’t been very lucky."</p><p>Alves has since joined OnlyFans and has been using the site to date her fans. "All my girlfriends use OnlyFans and they talked me into it. Before, I was reluctant at making an account, but now, after a week on it, I'm loving it," she told the Daily Mail. "It is a controlled website on my terms and I am getting to interact with some very nice genuine fans and I hope to find my Prince Charming soon," she explained.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoopWowKqvwGaYpa6VqHqmxIybprKeop6yr7CMoaymmZ5iuKa6jJ2mpaRdqb%2BiutJmrqilkaN6rrvDnqNmr5%2Bir27A0ZqlrKiclru1ecaimJynnaR6tr7Toqo%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogS - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
