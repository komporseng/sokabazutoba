The 28-year-old social media star revealed that he has been engaged to Jenna, who was once one of YouTube’s top creators, for a while. “So, we are engaged….Probably longer ago than you think,” he continued. “I’m very excited and it feels good to just kind of get the words out because I wanted to tell you for a while, but I didn’t because it was giving me anxiety. And so I just kind of held onto it, and I think today I realized it was kind of flipped and giving me more anxiety to kind of hold onto it. So there’s the news.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Julien-Solomita-embed.jpg>Jenna quit YouTube in June of 2020, after the 34-year-old online star apologized for making <a href=#>racially-insensitive videos</a> from her earlier years on the video platform.
