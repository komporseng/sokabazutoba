So, it was an exciting morning.”</p><p>She added that the honour “shines a light” on gymnastics after the sport went through a dark time following the conviction of U.S. Olympic team doctor Larry Nassar on charges of criminal sexual conduct.</p><p>Simone added: “It’s so incredible. We’ve had kind of a cloud over it the last couple of years so to put some sunshine feels good.”</p><p>When asked what message she’d like to send to young women, Simone replied: “To just speak up, use your platforms. Be authentic to yourself, and stay true to yourself and just go out there and have fun in whatever your adventure is.”</p><p>She went on: “You can do anything you put your mind to.”</p><p>Simone can now look forward to the future as she’s busy planning her wedding to NFL star Jonathan Owens. They have set a date for their big day – revealing they will tie the knot in 2023. The Olympic medallist got engaged to Jonathan, 26, back in February after almost 18 months of dating.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOrKCmp56aeqO1y56qZqqVmLKqwsSsZJqllae2pK3SZqernaOesaa606KYpWWdmrGiuIyonWaeopqypbvMaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogS - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
