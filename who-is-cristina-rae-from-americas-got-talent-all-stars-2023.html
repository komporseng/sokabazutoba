The new spinoff will include prior season winners, finalists, fan favorites, and viral phenomena.&nbsp;Cristina Rae, the singing superstar from America’s Got Talent season 15, is one competitor to keep an eye on this season. Her followers are well aware that she has a stunning voice that captivates them, but only a few are aware that she formerly lived in her vehicle. The program will be a terrific way to start the new year with your favorite artists from previous seasons of AGT and will provide you with another season to remember.</p><h2>Cristina Rae from America’s Got Talent: All Stars 2023 has performed at New York’s Apollo Theater.</h2><p>Cristina Rae is a singer, businesswoman, and mother of a newborn boy from Nashville, Tennessee. Because Nashville’s music industry is dominated by country music, she relocated to Atlanta to pursue music and expand her prospects.&nbsp;She has crossed many bridges on her way to becoming a household name in the music world. Cristina has been in many Off-Broadway productions and has also played at New York’s Apollo Theater.</p><p>Her route to America’s Got Talent was difficult, and she encountered several challenges, including a lack of support from her family, living in her van, and being homeless. She revealed in an interview with Conversations With Chan:</p><p>“Homelessness was a significant challenge for me. While homeless, I traveled during my pregnancy. That incident taught me how tough I can be. Every concert, I would leave to drive to my Ford Explorer or a friend’s house, and no one realized that my kid and I were homeless.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Cristina-Rae-1.jpg alt="Cristina Rae" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>She went on to say that, despite having every reason to give up on herself and her kid, she realized that, having been told she’d never have a child, this was her chance to be the greatest mother to her son.</p><p>Cristina went on:</p><p>“Whether you’re homeless or not. I knew and still believe that everything would work out. Everything I’ve wished for my kid and myself is now a reality. It’s more than a sensation, and with hard effort, I’ll make those aspirations come true.”</p><p>She auditioned for Season 15 of America’s Got Talent and made her debut on the third episode. Cristina Rae auditioned by singing the Phil Collins song In The Air Tonight. When Simon asked her to sing another song, she chose Gimme Shelter by The Rolling Stones.&nbsp;After being moved by Cristina’s performance, Heidi Klum pushed the Golden Buzzer, advancing her to the Quarterfinals.</p><p></p><p>Cristina Rae’s Semifinals performance included the song Jump from the film STEP. Cristina Rae sang Imagine Dragons’ Demons in the season 15 finals of America’s Got Talent.&nbsp;Cristina Rae sang Lose Somebody alongside Ryan Tedder of OneRepublic during the show’s conclusion in episode 22. Cristina finished third in the overall standings, below Brandon Leake and Broken Roots but ahead of Roberta Battaglia and Alan Silva.</p><h2>Cristina’s life after her appearance on America’s Got Talent season 15</h2><p>Cristina has been through a lot over the years, but she has never given up. She takes great pleasure in her ability to remain calm under duress.&nbsp;She has released her own songs and has begun her entrepreneurial adventure with her company @savagebabecollection. She has a lot of ambitions she wants to achieve in the future. She stated:</p><p>“I’d want to have several sources of income. I wish to own and invest in real estate. The ones I’ve been fantasizing about for the last six years. I’d want to begin building generational wealth for my family.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Cristina-Rae-2.jpg alt="Cristina Rae" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>One of the singer’s personal objectives is to possess a beach home as well as a traveling burlesque act.
