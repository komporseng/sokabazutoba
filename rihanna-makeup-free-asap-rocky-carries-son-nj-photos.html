Riri rocked a head-to-toe black leisure suit with hoodie and carried a brown faux fur coat as she walked on the tarmac, pulling her hair into a casual updo and accessorizing with chic sunglasses and socks with slide sandals. She went completely makeup free for a fresh-faced appearance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Rihanna-Makeup-Free-ASAP-Date-Spl-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>Rocky wore lime green pants, a leather jacket, and black sneakers as he cuddled his little boy, who wore white Nike socks and a navy jacket.

You really don’t remember life before, that’s the craziest thing ever. You literally try to remember it — and there are photos of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>my life before</a> — but the feeling, the desires, the things that you enjoy, everything, you just don’t identify with it because you don’t even allow yourself mentally to get that far because… Because it doesn’t matter.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Rihanna-Makeup-Free-ASAP-Date-Spl-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Another aspect of parenthood that admittedly caught her off guard, was the feeling of walking out of the hospital no longer a couple, but a full family. “I cannot believe it,” she said in part. “Essentially, from one person <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>I became two</a>. You walk into the hospital as a couple and leave as <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a family of three</a>.
