Among the items she collected were denatured alcohol, nails, and a mason jar.</p><p>When she tried to test out a wick, the guard realized what the suspicious woman was up to: she was trying to build a bomb, right there inside the store.</p><p>Florida’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WFLA is reporting</a> that 37-year-old Emily Stallard was indeed collecting materials for a makeshift bomb with her son in tow and that the alarmed security guard quickly reported the woman to the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office.</p><p>The security guard also notified an off-duty Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation officer who was in the store at the time. Together, the two men stopped Stallard before she lit a wick that would presumably have detonated her DIY device. When sheriff deputies arrived on the scene, the security officer and FWC officer had successfully detained her.</p><p>In a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">statement from the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office</a>, officials said that the assortment of items Stallard also included projectile items and matches.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-258758 alt="Emily Stallard Mugshot" width=560 height=700 data-sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/emily-stallard-mugshot.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-258758 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office</span><span class=caption-body>Emily Stallard was arrested and charged on multiple accounts after her bomb plot.</span></p><p>“This woman had all the supplies she needed to cause mass destruction at her disposal,” said Sheriff Chad Chronister. “Had it not been for an alert off-duty law enforcement officer and a watchful security staff at Walmart, she may have followed through with her plans to cause an explosion inside the store.”</p><p>He added: “I am proud of the quick response by the officer and security personnel who stepped in and the thorough job performed by my deputies to investigate this matter and make an arrest.”</p><p>After the possibly lethal incident was diffused, Stallard was arrested, though she managed to spit at the deputies while they were loading her into the police car. Following the incident, a Walmart representative said in a statement put out by the company: “We take the safety and security of our customers and associates seriously. We appreciate the quick response of local law enforcement and are assisting them as they investigate the matter.”</p><p>Stallard has been charged with firebombing, attempted arson of a structure, contributing to the delinquency of a minor, child abuse, and battery on a law enforcement officer. She remains behind bars with bail set at $8,500.</p><p>The incident no doubt has the retail chain’s employees and customers on edge after <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the deadly shooting</a> inside of a Walmart store in El Paso, Texas, in August 2019. Twenty-two people were killed in the El Paso shooting while two dozen more were injured.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-258761 alt="Walmart El Paso Shooting Victims" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/walmart-el-paso-shooting-victims.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-258761 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Xinhua/Wang Ying via Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>Crosses with names of victims placed near the Walmart center where a mass shooting took place in August 2019.</span></p><p>The ad hoc bombmaking attempt serves as a jarring reminder of just how unpredictable these kinds of attacks can be — even in the most mundane of places.</p><p>According to the US’ Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, a total of 1,288 bomb threats were <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> in 2017. The same report indicated “education, office/business, residential, and assembly” as the top four targeted venues of bomb threats with restaurants and courthouses making up half of the assembly targeted venues that year.</p><p>Just last week there were at least three separate bomb threats reported in courthouses in Wisconsin, Washington, and Pennsylvania. One of the cases involved a man who <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">called in a bomb threat</a> at the Lewis County courthouse in Washington state to impede court proceedings in a case he was involved in. The man has since been arrested and jailed with a $500,000 bail bond.</p><p>The unpredictability and randomness involved in these types of attacks can be disheartening, but the best way to combat possible bomb attacks is to stay vigilant.</p><p>“I can’t stress enough: if you see something, say something,” Sheriff Chronister said. “You don’t have to tackle a bad guy to be a hero. One phone call to law enforcement when you spot something or someone suspicious can ultimately save lives.”</p><p>Next, read the true story of <a href=#>Richard Jewell</a>, the hero-turned-suspect in the 1996 Olympic bombing.
