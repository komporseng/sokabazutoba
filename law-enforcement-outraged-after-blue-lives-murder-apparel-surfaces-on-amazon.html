They should sell shirts that say, ‘Blue Lives Save Lives.’”</p><p>In its letter, the DEA demanded that Amazon “immediately” take down items with the “Blue Lives Murder” slogan because the phrase’s “only purpose is to invite further division, hatred and violence toward the hard-working men and women of the nation’s Police Departments, who are toiling every day to keep their communities safe.”</p><p>“To continue to hawk products emblazoned with this vile phrase puts the lives of Police Officers, and all law enforcement nationwide, at peril and risk,” the letter said.</p><p>The letter was also blasted out to detectives via email who were encourged to “adapt” it and send their own version to Amazon.</p><p>The letter also cites the online retailer’s policy of not listing products that “promote, incite, or glorify hatred, violence, racial, sexual or religious intolerance, or promote organization with such views.”</p><figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized">Another “Blue Lives Murder” T-shirt being sold on Amazon.<span class=credit>Amazon</span></figure><p>“They are hypocrites. They say they don’t sell items that incite hatred,” fumed a Brooklyn detective. “I can’t think of an item that incites hatred more than these sweatshirts.”</p><p>Amazon did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>In June 2020, after a Minneapolis police officer <a href=#>killed George Floyd</a>, igniting protests across the country and the five boroughs, similar “Blue Lives Murder” T-shirts were sold on Amazon. The 2020 merchandise appears to have since been removed from the site.</p><p>“It shows that [Amazon is] bending over backwards for this movement like many other companies are,” Sgt. Joe Imperatrice, who founded Blue Lives Matter NYC, said at the time.</p><p>The company has in the past yanked racist, anti-Semitic and sexist items that have caused controversy.</p><p>In July, it <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">removed</a> neo-Nazi books and Ku Klux Klan merchandise. The company in August also <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">pulled down</a> shirts with the phrase “Joe and Hoe” that disparaged the then-Vice Presidential nominee Kamala Harris.</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Nypost.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnnJbEbrHNn6arm5Wisq%2FAjKisraqRnLKlecCfq56qXZe5trGMpaCvnaNiura%2Bw56pZpmgpa6zsctmqq6qlpawpr%2BMqKVmmZ2Wx7C6jg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogS - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
