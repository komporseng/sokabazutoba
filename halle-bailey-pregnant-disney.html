Lori Harvey, a socialite and model, has been the subject of media interest for years, largely because of the mystery she has been able to preserve around her s*xual life.</p><p>Coupled with the fact that female celebrities are perpetually subjected to “baby watch,” especially after a long-term commitment or a recent nuptial announcement, this is especially true for those who are pregnant. However, it seems like Disney star Halle Bailey is the most recent celebrity to become entangled in the web of pregnancy rumors. Is that the case? Will Halle Bailey have a baby? The complete list of facts is below.</p><h2>Is Halle Bailey Pregnant?</h2><p>Halle and her partner DDG have been the subject of widespread baby rumors since the middle of August 2023.&nbsp;According to our sources, Halle did not share any photos of her tummy on social media between the beginning of July and the middle of August of 2023. They suspect she is keeping an unplanned pregnancy from them.</p><p>Halle appeared in some images with her back to the camera and loose clothing. So naturally, people assume she’s trying to hide a pregnancy bump. Halle has now uploaded a plethora of videos and photographs disproving rumors that she is pregnant. Halle has been silent about the rumors, but her followers assume that her posts in late August 2023 were a response to the speculation.</p><p><strong>Here you can also read about other celebrities who might be expecting a child in the future:</strong></p><h2>Halle Bailey Sister Chloe Pushed up Against Rumors of her Sibling’s Pregnancy</h2><p>The Bailey sisters always support one another and never take the spotlight away from the other.

Chloe thanked the stylist on 9MagTV for doing her hair and said, “Thank you.” “Hallelujah, amen. About to make me very angry. Anyways.” As soon as the rumors began to circulate, Chloe’s supporters commended her for sticking up for her sister. Many people have pointed out that the sisters always defend one other when they face criticism.</p><h2>Halle Bailey’s October 2023 Paparazzi Photos Have the Internet Convinced She’s Expecting</h2><p>The Shade Room’s Instagram account just shared a photo of Halle and her boyfriend DDG enjoying the night out.
