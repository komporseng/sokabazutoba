He appears in the show with his girlfriend Lisa Horne. Find out details about his age, height, parents, and job in this article below.</p><p>We cover it all here in this article below.</p><h3><strong>Netflix’s The Ultimatum Season 2: Are Brian Okoye And Lisa Horne Still Together?</strong></h3><p>Netflix’s The Ultimatum’s contestants Brian Okoye and <a href=#>Lisa Horne</a> haven’t updated any details on their current standing as of August 2023.</p><p>Ultimatums aren’t exactly new to Lisa Horne and Brian Okoye. After six months of sporadic hookups, Lisa ended their one-time relationship by forcing Brian to choose between love and friendship once and for all. They had been together for one and a half years after he made the decision to dedicate himself entirely to Lisa.</p><p>While it means the world to Lisa to see her 10-year-old daughter connect with Brian, Brian appreciates how Lisa challenges him to be the greatest version of himself.</p><p>The pair is currently at a crossroads because they disagree on when to get married and establish a family. “If he’s not ready to propose,” says Lisa, “then [she’s] ready to move on.” Due to Lisa’s issues with jealousy and propensity to escalate disputes into violent altercations, Brian is reluctant to make the proposal.</p><p>The future of Lisa and Brian’s relationship is still in grave danger unless they can learn to communicate well.</p><p>However, it turns out that they too struggle with trust, as was made clear in both episodes 1 and 2 when Lisa became overcome by emotion while witnessing her beau’s connection with Jeriah “Riah” Nyree. In reality, Brian wasn’t acting inappropriately; rather, he was only conversing with Riah as required by the show’s rules during the week before he had to choose a partner for a trial marriage.</p><p>But this devastated Lisa more than she could have ever anticipated, and she totally lost her composure; she stormed out, yelled at him, and just found herself tearing apart before expressing regret for dragging him along to this experiment. However, Brian never confronted her directly during this time; he was assertive, he got his point across, and he did his best to make her see her fault in this drama, yet to seemingly no avail.</p><p>When she realized she was pregnant with Brian’s child, things abruptly changed; instead of leaving this experiment alone as she had hinted she wanted to, they walked out together. Brian was ecstatic to hear the results of the test she had taken while filming, as he had always wanted to leave a legacy in the form of children. However, he insisted that his views on marrying so soon had not altered. The pair made the decision to end the experiment without saying goodbye to anyone after realizing they needed to work through many issues in secret over the following months.</p><p>Lisa, 32, is an absolute badass. According to Netflix, she is the vice president of a business that provides therapeutic services. She appears to be modeling as well, which makes sense, to be honest.</p><h3><strong>Brian Okoye Age</strong></h3><p>Brian Okoye’s age in 2023 is 29.
