Instead, we shall rely on her father, who is currently thought to have a net worth of $130 million as of January 2023.

Valentina was born at the Monteprincipe hospital in Madrid at 10:30 a.m. In a hospital gown, helmet, and face mask, Diego published an Instagram snapshot of himself cradling his baby daughter.</p><p>“Welcome, Valentina,” he wrote as the photo’s caption. Valentine is two years younger than Francesca and is said to have weighed more than 6 pounds when he was born. Giovanni, Gianluca, and Giuliano Simeone are her half-siblings.</p><p>In truth, her parents had a clandestine wedding in Buenos Aires.
