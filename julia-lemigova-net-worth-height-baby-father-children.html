The two came with their friends, danced, and their eyes met while they were resting. “There’s this gorgeous woman standing at the bar and she’s like … looking at me,” Martina said.</span></p><p><span>According to Julia, she gave Martina a kind of “Russian look — Really, it was more like, ‘Okay, you are coming to talk to me now.’”</span></p><p><span>However, their love story couldn’t move forward at the time.</span></p><p><span>Eight years later, the two reconnected at the French Open 2008, and only then, they started dating. After six years of dating bliss, Martina finally bent her knee (literally) in public, on camera, at the US Open 2014, and Julia gladly said Yes.</span></p><p><span>Fast forward to 2021, Julia and Martina finally held a private wedding, with COVID-19 restrictions in consideration.</span></p><p><span>The lovebirds also have discussed their relationship on Channel 4’s </span><span>Married to a Celebrity: The Survival Guide</span><span>.

Unfortunately,.he was murdered by another long-time lover Cécile Brossard, who got sentenced to eight years in prison in 2009.</span></p><p><span>Stern was in a Head-to-Toe latex catsuit when he was shot four times by Cécile.</span></p><p><span><strong>Trivia:</strong> Martina came out as bisexual in 1988.</span></p><h3><b>How Many Children Does Julia Lemigova Have?</b></h3><p><span>Julia Lemigova has two daughters named Victoria And Emma, from two different relationships.</span></p><p><span>Also, she had a son (born in 1999) fathered by Edouard Stern. Unfortunately, the baby died just five months later of internal injuries.</span></p><p><span>According to Julia, her oldest daughter was very upset when she first heard of her mother’s relationship with Martina. One day, she just came from school and asked, “Who is Martina?”</span></p><p><span>Julia retorted, “Martina is someone I love. And I can’t imagine living without her.”</span></p><p><span>The mother-daughter then sat down and talked. And the conversation ended with her daughter saying, “I want her to live with us, too.”</span></p><p><span>At the time, Julia’s family split their time between France and US, and her daughter only spoke French and Russian. So, to find a common ground, Julia and Martina tried speaking Czech and Russian, but that didn’t work.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“The girls speak French between themselves, English to Martina and Russian to me,”&nbsp; Julia shared.</span></p><h3><b>Who Is Julia Lemigova Children’s Baby Father?</b></h3><p><span>Latter two of Julia’s baby fathers chose to remain anonymous. So, all we know about is her first baby-daddy Edouard Stern, the father of Maximilian.</span></p><p><span>Julia and Edouard were lovers from 1997 to 2000. But Edouard rejected both Julia and her baby after Maximilian was born. However, when a colleague suggested a paternity test, Edouard decided he could have been one of three men who were potential fathers.</span></p><p><span>Unfortunately, before paternity became the issue, Maximilian passed away from a brain injury, possibly caused by excessive shaking.</span></p><p><span>There were also rumors that Julia was briefly married to a Moscow model agency founder who helped propel her to fame.</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li><h4><b>How Old Is Julia Lemigova?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Julia Lemigova was born on 26 June 1972.
