Pour over the bread and store overnight in the refrigerator.</p><p>When ready to bake, make the topping.</p><p>Mix flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, salt, and nutmeg and cut in butter with a fork until the mixture looks like crumbs.</p><p>Sprinkle over the top and bake until the texture you desire. One can eat this French Toast more on the crispy side or like a bread pudding.</p><p>Top with syrup and fruit.</p><h2>‘The Pioneer Woman’ fans the recipe for Cinnamon-Baked French Toast a thumbs-up</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=4><p></p><p><span>▶</span>” src=”https://www.youtube.com/embed/eD1zIGuMjRg?feature=oembed” frameborder=”0″ allow=”accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture” allowfullscreen></p>Another Ree Drummond family favorite is Tater Tot Casserole, perfect for a savory breakfast main dish.</figure><p>Viewers of The Pioneer Woman loved the ease of the recipe and the delicious result.</p><p>“Easy, and everyone loved it!
