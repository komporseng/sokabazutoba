Furthermore, Jeff also followed the proposal with one of Maria’s favorite songs “I’m the Man Who Loves You.”</span></p><p><span>“Thank you Wilco and Jeff and everyone involved in making this incredible moment actually happen. I’m forever grateful. I love you, Maria,” Chris later wrote on IG.</span></p><p><span>Talking about their relationship, Chris once shared in an interview, “Maria and I fully accept each other for who we are.” And it wasn’t just the things they had in common, but also they embraced their quirks and differences — “and we don’t love each other in spite of them, we love each other because of them,” he explained.</span></p><p><span>Chris added that it was the moment he first met her and got to time together for a few months that he realized their “creative brains were also totally in sync.”</span></p><p><span>Likewise, Maria felt the same way about Chris. “It’s funny how life works sometimes and gives you gifts when you’re not looking for them,” she said. Also, recalling their first encounter, she pointed out that they were immediately comfortable with one another. “Call it weird, mystical, or magical, it’s like we’d known each other in a past life. After spending that first day together (though I didn’t know how), I just somehow knew that my life would never be the same after meeting Chris.”</span></p><h3><b>Who Is Maria Libri Ex-Husband?</b></h3><p><span>Maria Libri was married to her ex-husband <a href=#>John Sigle</a> until 2021.</span></p><p><span>Her ex-husband, John is a Springfield, Illinois native who went to </span><i><span>Sacred Heart – Griffin High School</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>William Scholl College of Podiatric Medicine</span></i><span>, and the </span><i><span>University of Illinois</span></i><span>.
