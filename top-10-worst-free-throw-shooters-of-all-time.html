Free throws can turn a game around and break the rhythm of another team. In this article, we'll take a look back to discover and learn how the top 10 worst free throw shooters of all time became what they are.&nbsp;We will look at and investigate this factor individually for a player shooting the free throw, as well as omitting its effect on football teams' performance and extending it up in sports culture.</span></p><h2><b>Methodology</b></h2><p><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Certain parameters had to be met before being considered. Players must have a minimum number of free throw attempts, and the career average was also weighted into the final list. In the course of our research, we determined those players who have statistically struggled at trying conditions in NBA games over time through sound databases such as NBA stats, player draft profiles, and record progression. We also examined how free throw shooting can affect a team's and player-level success.</span></p><h2><b>10 Worst Free Throw Shooters</b></h2><h3><b>1. Ben Wallace</b></h3><p><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;"><span data-mce-fragment=1>Career&nbsp;</span>Free Throw Percentage: 41.4 %</span></p><p><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Ben Wallace had a lengthy career, earning an NBA championship with the Detroit Pistons in 2004 despite his struggles at shooting from the line.</span></p><h3><b>2. Wilt Chamberlain</b></h3><p><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;"><span data-mce-fragment=1>Career&nbsp;</span>Free&nbsp;Throw Percentage: 51.1%&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Wilt Chamberlain had a 51.1% free-throw percentage with the NBA. He had several records and top performances, but one of the things he will always be remembered for is his shortcomings at the free-throw line.</span></p><p><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Chamberlain's 7-foot-1 height, which made for more of a heave than an actual throw at the free-throw line, and his clumsy shooting form are among the factors that may have contributed to him sinking just 511% of his attempts.</span></p><h3><b>3. Shaquille O'Neal</b></h3><p><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;"><span data-mce-fragment=1>Career&nbsp;</span>Free Throw Percentage: 52.7%</span></p><p><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">A force in his prime on the court, Shaquille O'Neal struggled to shoot free throws throughout his career. A big talking point of his career was the 50% from&nbsp;the line.</span></p><h3><b>4. DeAndre Jordan</b></h3><p><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;"><span data-mce-fragment=1>Career&nbsp;</span>Free Throw Percentage: 41.7%</span></p><p><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">His horrid free throws opened up hack. His numbers and FT misses will be one of the leading narratives from his career.&nbsp;</span><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Jordan's defensive mindset and physical stature may have affected him from the charity stripe.</span></p><h3><b>5. Chris Dudley</b></h3><p><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;"><span data-mce-fragment=1>Career&nbsp;</span><span data-mce-fragment=1>Free&nbsp;</span><span data-mce-fragment=1>Throw Percentage:&nbsp;</span>45.8%</span></p><p><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Chris Dudley, an infamously poor free-throw shooter, is remembered fondly for his rebounding and defensive contributions.&nbsp;</span><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Dudley focused only on the defense role; he had his mind set on things different than missing down on free throws.</span></p><h3><b>6. Johnny Green</b></h3><p><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;"><span data-mce-fragment=1>Career&nbsp;</span><span data-mce-fragment=1>Free&nbsp;</span><span data-mce-fragment=1>Throw Percentage:</span>&nbsp;55.3%</span></p><p><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;One of the best rebounders in NBA Bullets history, but he shot 66 percent from the line. As much value as he added to the game in other ways, it kept returning to this one fundamental shortcoming.</span></p><h3><b>7. Bill Russell</b></h3><p><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;"><span data-mce-fragment=1>Career&nbsp;</span><span data-mce-fragment=1>Free&nbsp;</span><span data-mce-fragment=1>Throw Percentage:&nbsp;</span>56.1%</span></p><p><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Bill Russell, who was legendary for his success on the court and his defensive abilities, struggled at times from the free-throw line. One of the black marks on his sparkling career is this batting statistic.</span></p><h3><b>8. Dwight Howard</b></h3><p><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;"><span data-mce-fragment=1>Career&nbsp;</span><span data-mce-fragment=1>Free&nbsp;</span><span data-mce-fragment=1>Throw Percentage:</span> 56.7%</span></p><p><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;"> Howard might have been focusing more on defensive help and pounding other guys in the paint, which took a significant toll on his free-throw shooting.</span></p><h3><b>9. Josh Smith</b></h3><p><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;"><span data-mce-fragment=1>Career&nbsp;</span><span data-mce-fragment=1>Free&nbsp;</span><span data-mce-fragment=1>Throw Percentage:</span> 63.2 %</span><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps the most versatile player at camp was Josh Smith, but he struggled to hit free throws. His career stats, however, underscore one thing he made a point to shore up.</span></p><h3><b>10. Rudy Gobert</b></h3><p><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;"><span data-mce-fragment=1>Career&nbsp;</span><span data-mce-fragment=1>Free&nbsp;</span><span data-mce-fragment=1>Throw Percentage:</span> 63.9%</span></p><p><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Gobert does such good work at preventing buckets near the rim with his defense, which he focused on influencing more than free throw shooting.</span></p><p><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Analyzing the all-time&nbsp;10 worst free throwers in history to gain new perspectives on why they struggle so much at the foul line. Poor free throw shooting leads to more than individual stats. It affects the way teams play and often brings about different game outcomes. It adds another context about the game's depth regarding why players underperform at one-dimensional aspects like free throw shooting. This exploration simply serves as a brief reminder of basketball's varied skills and challenges, which are ultimately essential threads in its rich tapestry.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0milm5lfqbyxeZBpZLCnoqjBbrLRnpxmrJinvLh50qGmqKyVp8Buu8VmmKWkXam2rrE%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogS - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
